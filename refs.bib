   abstract = {Stochasticity plays an essential role in the dynam- ics of biochemical systems. Stochastic behaviors of bimodality, excitability, and fluctuations are present in biochemical reaction networks at low molecular numbers. These stochastic dynamics can be captured by modeling the system using a forward Kolmogorov equation known in the biochemical literature as the chemical master equation. The chemical master equa- tion describes the time evolution of probability distributions of molecule species in the system. We develop a stochastic framework for the design of these time evolving probability distributions. Our design specifications include their uni-/multi- modality, the locations of their modes, and their rate of convergence to the stationary distribution. We formulate these specifications as constraints in an optimization program that determines the desired reaction rate values. We apply our design framework to examples of biochemical reaction networks to illustrate its strengths and limitations.},

This connectivity generates molecular network diagrams that resemble complex electrical circuits, and a systematic understanding will require the development of a mathematical framework for describing the circuitry. From an engineering perspective, the natural path towards such a framework is the construction and analysis of the underlying submodules that constitute the network. Recent experimental advances in both sequencing and genetic engineering have made this approach feasible through the design and implementation of synthetic gene networks amenable to mathematical modelling and quantitative analysis. These developments have signalled the emergence of a gene circuit discipline, which provides a framework for predicting and evaluating the dynamics of cellular processes. Synthetic gene networks will also lead to new logical forms of cellular control, which could have important applications in functional genomics, nanotechnology, and gene and cell therapy. I},

We analyzed the probabilistic and transient differentiation of Bacillus subtilis cells into the state of competence. A few key parameters independently tuned the frequency of initiation and the duration of competence episodes and allowed the circuit to access different dynamic regimes, including oscillation. Altering circuit architecture showed that the duration of competence events can be made more precise. We used an experimental method to reduce global cellular noise and showed that noise levels are correlated with frequency of differentiation events. Together, the data reveal a noise-dependent circuit that is remarkably resilient and tunable in terms of its dynamic behavior. hree},

   abstract = {Light has emerged as a control input for biological systems due to its precise spatiotemporal resolution. The limited toolset for light control in bacteria motivated us to develop a light-inducible transcription system that is independent from cellular regulation through the use of an orthogonal RNA polymerase. Here, we present our engineered blue light-responsive T7 RNA polymerases (Opto-T7RNAPs) that show properties such as low leakiness of gene expression in the dark state, high expression strength when induced with blue light, and an inducible range of more than 300-fold. Following optimization of the system to reduce expression variability, we created a variant that returns to the inactive dark state within minutes once the blue light is turned off. This allows for precise dynamic control of gene expression, which is a key aspect for most applications using optogenetic regulation. The regulators, which only require blue light from ordinary light-emitting diodes for induction, were developed and tested in the bacterium Escherichia coli, which is a crucial cell factory for biotechnology due to its fast and inexpensive cultivation and well understood physiology and genetics. Opto-T7RNAP, with minor alterations, should be extendable to other bacterial species as well as eukaryotes such as mammalian cells and yeast in which the T7 RNA polymerase and the light-inducible Vivid regulator have been shown to be functional. We anticipate that our approach will expand the applicability of using light as an inducer for gene expression independent from cellular regulation and allow for a more reliable dynamic control of synthetic and natural gene networks.},

Here we present an approach that couples libraries of diversified components (synthesized with randomized nonessential sequence) with in silico modeling to guide predictable gene network construction without the need for post hoc tweaking. We demonstrate our approach in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by synthesizing regulatory promoter libraries and using them to construct feed-forward loop networks with different predicted input-output characteristics. We then expand our method to produce a synthetic gene network acting as a predictable timer, modifiable by component choice. We use this network to control the timing of yeast sedimentation, illustrating how the plug-and-play nature of our design can be readily applied to biotechnology.},

   abstract = {De novo-designed proteins hold great promise as building blocks for synthetic circuits, and can complement the use of engineered variants of natural proteins. One such designer protein—degronLOCKR, which is based on ‘latching orthogonal cage–key proteins’ (LOCKR) technology—is a switch that degrades a protein of interest in vivo upon induction by a genetically encoded small peptide. Here we leverage the plug-and-play nature of degronLOCKR to implement feedback control of endogenous signalling pathways and synthetic gene circuits. We first generate synthetic negative and positive feedback in the yeast mating pathway by fusing degronLOCKR to endogenous signalling molecules, illustrating the ease with which this strategy can be used to rewire complex endogenous pathways. We next evaluate feedback control mediated by degronLOCKR on a synthetic gene circuit9, to quantify the feedback capabilities and operational range of the feedback control circuit. The designed nature of degronLOCKR proteins enables simple and rational modifications to tune feedback behaviour in both the synthetic circuit and the mating pathway. The ability to engineer feedback control into living cells represents an important milestone in achieving the full potential of synthetic biology. More broadly, this work demonstrates the large and untapped potential of de novo design of proteins for generating tools that implement complex synthetic functionalities in cells for biotechnological and therapeutic applications.},

   abstract = {Bacterial pathogens have evolved specific effector proteins that, by interfacing with host kinase signalling pathways, provide a mechanism to evade immune responses during infection. Although these effectors contribute to pathogen virulence, we realized that they might also serve as valuable synthetic biology reagents for engineering cellular behaviour. Here we exploit two effector proteins, the Shigella flexneri OspF protein and Yersinia pestis YopH protein, to rewire kinase-mediated responses systematically both in yeast and mammalian immune cells. Bacterial effector proteins can be directed to inhibit specific mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways selectively in yeast by artificially targeting them to pathway-specific complexes. Moreover, we show that unique properties of the effectors generate new pathway behaviours: OspF, which irreversibly inactivates mitogen-activated protein kinases, was used to construct a synthetic feedback circuit that shows novel frequency-dependent input filtering. Finally, we show that effectors can be used in T cells, either as feedback modulators to tune the T-cell response amplitude precisely, or as an inducible pause switch that can temporarily disable T-cell activation. These studies demonstrate how pathogens could provide a rich toolkit of parts to engineer cells for therapeutic or biotechnological applications. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Using trigger-controlled transcription factors, which independently control gene expression, and RNA-binding proteins that inhibit the translation of transcripts harbouring specific RNA target motifs, we have designed a set of synthetic transcription–translation control devices that could be rewired in a plug-and-play manner. Here we show that these combinatorial circuits integrated a two-molecule input and performed digital computations with NOT, AND, NAND and N-IMPLY expression logic in single mammalian cells. Functional interconnection of two N-IMPLY variants resulted in bitwise intracellular XOR operations, and a combinatorial arrangement of three logic gates enabled independent cells to perform programmable half-subtractor and half-adder calculations.

Unlike traditional control engineering applications, cells grow and divide over time, and the natural variability arising in individual cell gene expression makes the population time-varying and heterogeneous. Therefore, the application of tried and tested control approaches can be often problematic. Here, using a microfluidics-based experimental platform, in which either glucose or galactose is provided to the cells, we measured expression from the galactose-inducible promoter in individual cells for thousands of minutes. We identified single cell linear dynamical models across hundreds of cells via a recently proposed linear mixed-effects identification strategy. We show that these models are able to capture the expression dynamics of single cells but also the mean and standard deviation of the population, thus making realistic simulation of gene expression possible. We then compared the performance of a Model-Predictive-Control strategy to solve regulation and tracking problem when based either on a deterministic model of the mean expression of the cell population, or on the individual models of the single cells.},

We employ a modular design strategy to create Escherichia coli strains where a genetic toggle switch is interfaced with: (i) the SOS signaling pathway responding to DNA damage, and (ii) a transgenic quorum sensing signaling pathway from Vibrio fischeri. The genetic toggle switch endows these strains with binary response dynamics and an epigenetic inheritance that supports a persistent phenotypic alteration in response to transient signals. These features are exploited to engineer cells that form biofilms in response to DNA-damaging agents and cells that activate protein synthesis when the cell population reaches a critical density.

   abstract = {Cells are defined by their unique ability to self- replicate through cell division. This periodic process is known as the cell-cycle and it happens with a defined period in each cell. The budding yeast divides asymmetrically with a mother cell generating multiple daughter cells. Within the cell population each cell divides with the same period but asynchronously. Here, we investigate the problem of synchronising the cell- cycle across a population of yeast cells through a microfluidics- based feedback control platform. We propose a theoretical and experimental approach for cell-cycle control by considering a yeast strain that can be forced to start the cell-cycle by changing growth medium. The duration of the cell-cycle is strictly linked to the cell volume growth, hence a hard constraint in the controller design is to prevent excessive volume growth. We experimentally characterised the yeast strain and derived a simplified phase-oscillator model of the cell-cycle. We then designed and implemented three impulsive control strategies to achieve maximal synchronisation across the population and assessed their control performance by numerical simulations. The first two controllers are based on event-triggered strategies, while the third uses a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm to select the sequence of control impulses while satisfying built-in constraints on volume growth. We compared the three strategies by computing two cost functions: one quantifying the level of synchronisation across the cell population and the other volume growth during the process. We demonstrated that the proposed control approaches can effectively achieve an acceptable trade-off between two conflicting control objectives: (i) obtaining maximal synchronisation of the cell cycle across the population while (ii) minimizing volume growth. The results can be used to implement effective strategies to unfold the biological mechanisms controlling cell cycle and volume growth in yeast cells. I.},

In engineering, this ability can be embedded in devices ranging from the thermostat to the autopilot of a modern plane using control systems which operate via a negative feedback mechanism: the quantity to be controlled is measured then subtracted from the desired reference value, and the resulting error is used to compute the control action to be implemented on the physical system (e.g. switching on or off the heating, changing the position of the rudder). Here, we developed and applied a method to regulate the expression level of a protein, in a growing population of cells over several generations, in a completely automatic fashion. We designed and implemented an integrated platform comprising a microfluidic device, a time-lapse microscopy apparatus, and a set of motorized syringes, all controlled by a computer. We tested the platform to force yeast cells to express a desired time-varying amount of a gene in yeast. Our method can be applied to control a protein of interest in vivo allowing to probe the function of biological systems in unprecedented ways.},

The complexity of signal transduction and gene regulation makes it challenging to analyze how the dynamic activity of transcriptional regulators affects stochastic transcription. By combining a fast-acting, photo-regulatable transcription factor with nascent RNA quantification in live cells and an experimental setup for precise spatiotemporal delivery of light inputs, we constructed a platform for the real-time, single-cell interrogation of transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that transcriptional activation and deactivation are fast and memoryless. By analyzing the temporal activity of individual cells, we found that transcription occurs in bursts, whose duration and timing are modulated by transcription factor activity. Using our platform, we regulated transcription via light-driven feedback loops at the single-cell level. Feedback markedly reduced cell-to-cell variability and led to qualitative differences in cellular transcriptional dynamics. Our platform establishes a flexible method for studying transcriptional dynamics in single cells. Rullan et al. develop an optogenetic framework for elucidating stochastic transcription at the single-cell level. Combining live-cell nascent RNA quantification with optogenetic transcription in an automated setup for spatiotemporal light delivery, the authors establish real-time light-based feedback control in single cells.

Here, we present a workflow for engineering systems of non-natural anti-repressors. In this study, we create 41 inducible anti-repressors. This collection of transcription factors respond to two distinct ligands, fructose (anti-FruR) or D-ribose (anti-RbsR); and were complemented by 14 additional engineered anti-repressors that respond to the ligand isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (anti-LacI). In turn, we use this collection of anti-repressors and complementary genetic architectures to confer logical control over gene expression.

Recent data indicate that NANOG is expressed in a variety of cancers and its expression correlates with poor survival in cancer patients. Of interest, many studies suggest that NANOG enhances the defined characteristics of cancer stem cells and may thus function as an oncogene to promote carcinogenesis. Therefore, NANOG expression determines the cell fate not only in pluripotent cells but also in cancer cells. Although the regulation of NANOG in normal embryonic stem cells is reasonably well understood, the regulation of NANOG in cancer cells has only emerged recently. The current review provides a most updated summary on how NANOG expression is regulated during tumor development and progression. Keywords},

Using fluorescent reporters for the expression of Nanog, we observed that a population of ES cells is best described by a dynamic distribution of Nanog expression characterized by two peaks defined by high (HN) and low (LN) Nanog expression. Typically, the LN state is 5%-20% of the total population, depending on the culture conditions. Modelling of the activity of Nanog reveals that a simple network of Oct4/Sox2 and Nanog activity can account for the observed distribution and its properties as long as the transcriptional activity is tuned by transcriptional noise. The model also predicts that the LN state is unstable, something that is born out experimentally. While in this state, cells can differentiate. We suggest that transcriptional fluctuations in Nanog expression are an essential element of the pluripotent state and that the function of Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog is to act as a network that promotes and maintains transcriptional noise to interfere with the differentiation signals. © 2009 Kalmar et al.},

Complex interactions between the environment and cells often arise through non-uniform nutrient availability, which generates bidirectional coupling as cells both adjust to and modify their local environment through phenotypic differentiation12,13. Although synthetic spatial gene expression patterns14–17 have been explored under homogeneous conditions, the mutual interaction of gene circuits, growth phenotype and the environment remains a challenge. Here, we design gene circuits that sense and control phenotypic structure in microcolonies containing both growing and dormant bacteria. We implement structure modulation by coupling different downstream modules to a tunable sensor that leverages Escherichia coli’s stress response and is activated on growth arrest. One is an actuator module that slows growth and thereby alters nutrient gradients. Environmental feedback in this circuit generates robust cycling between growth and dormancy in the interior of the colony, as predicted by a spatiotemporal computational model. We also use the sensor to drive an inducible gating module for selective gene expression in non-dividing cells, which allows us to radically alter population structure by eliminating the dormant phenotype with a ‘stress-gated lysis circuit‘. Our results establish a strategy to leverage and control microbial colony structure for synthetic biology applications in complex environments.},

These properties, which include multistabil- ity and oscillations, have been found in specialized gene circuits such as the bacteriophage l switch2 and the Cyanobacteria circadian oscillator3 . However, these behaviours have not been demonstrated in networks of non-specialized regulatory compo- nents. Here we present the construction of a genetic toggle switchÐa synthetic, bistable gene-regulatory networkÐin Escherichia coli and provide a simple theory that predicts the conditions necessary for bistability. The toggle is constructed from any two repressible promoters arranged in a mutually inhibitory network. It is ¯ipped between stable states using transient chemical or thermal induction and exhibits a nearly ideal switching threshold. As a practical device, the toggle switch forms a synthetic, addressable cellular memory unit and has implications for biotechnology, biocomputing and gene therapy.},

To address the fact that detailed knowledge about intracellular networks is unavailable, integral-feedback controllers (IFCs) have been put forward for controlling molecular abundances. These controllers can maintain accuracy in spite of the uncertainties in the controlled networks. However, this desirable feature is achieved only if stability is also maintained. In this paper, we show that molecular IFCs suffer from a hazardous instability called negative-equilibrium catastrophe (NEC), whereby all nonnegative equilibria vanish under the action of the controllers, and some of the underlying molecular abundances blow up. We show that unimolecular IFCs do not exist due to a NEC. We then derive a family of bimolecular IFCs that are safeguarded against NECs when unimolecular networks are controlled. However, we show that, without a detailed knowledge of the controlled systems, NECs cannot be prevented when IFCs are applied on bimolecular, and hence the vast majority of intracellular, networks.},

   abstract = {Light has emerged as a control input for biological systems due to its precise spatiotemporal resolution. The limited toolset for light control in bacteria motivated us to develop a light-inducible transcription system that is independent from cellular regulation through the use of an orthogonal RNA polymerase. Here, we present our engineered blue light-responsive T7 RNA polymerases (Opto-T7RNAPs) that show properties such as low leakiness of gene expression in the dark state, high expression strength when induced with blue light, and an inducible range of more than 300-fold. Following optimization of the system to reduce expression variability, we created a variant that returns to the inactive dark state within minutes once the blue light is turned off. This allows for precise dynamic control of gene expression, which is a key aspect for most applications using optogenetic regulation. The regulators, which only require blue light from ordinary light-emitting diodes for induction, were developed and tested in the bacterium Escherichia coli, which is a crucial cell factory for biotechnology due to its fast and inexpensive cultivation and well understood physiology and genetics. Opto-T7RNAP, with minor alterations, should be extendable to other bacterial species as well as eukaryotes such as mammalian cells and yeast in which the T7 RNA polymerase and the light-inducible Vivid regulator have been shown to be functional. We anticipate that our approach will expand the applicability of using light as an inducer for gene expression independent from cellular regulation and allow for a more reliable dynamic control of synthetic and natural gene networks.

A common problem with many WCMs is their inability to capture translation in sufficient detail to consider the impact of ribosomal queue formation on mRNA transcripts. To address this, we have built a “stochastic cell calculator” (StoCellAtor) that combines a modified TASEP with a stochastic implementation of an existing WCM. We show how our framework can be used to link a synthetic construct’s modular design (promoter, ribosome binding site (RBS) and codon composition) to protein yield during continuous culture, with a particular focus on the effects of low-efficiency codons and their impact on ribosomal queues. Through our analysis, we recover design principles previously established in our work on burden-sensing strategies, namely that changing promoter strength is often a more efficient way to increase protein yield than RBS strength. Importantly, however, we show how these design implications can change depending on both the duration of protein expression, and on the presence of ribosomal queues.},

   abstract = {Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary field aiming to design biochemical systems with desired behaviors. To this end, molecular controllers have been developed which, when embedded into a pre-existing ambient biochemical network, control the dynamics of the underlying target molecular species. When integrated into smaller compartments, such as biological cells in vivo, or vesicles in vitro, controllers have to be calibrated to factor in the intrinsic noise. In this context, molecular controllers put forward in the literature have focused on manipulating the mean (first moment), and reducing the variance (second moment), of the target species. However, many critical biochemical processes are realized via higher-order moments, particularly the number and configuration of the modes (maxima) of the probability distributions. To bridge the gap, a controller called stochastic morpher is put forward in this paper, inspired by gene-regulatory networks, which, under suitable time-scale separations, morphs the probability distribution of the target species into a desired predefined form. The morphing can be performed at the lower-resolution, allowing one to achieve desired multi-modality/multi-stability, and at the higher-resolution, allowing one to achieve arbitrary probability distributions. Properties of the controller, such as robust perfect adaptation and convergence, are rigorously established, and demonstrated on various examples. Also proposed is a blueprint for an experimental implementation of stochastic morpher.},

The expression of membrane transporters in metabolic pathways is often upregulated by the transporter substrate. In E. coli, such systems include for example the lacY, araFGH, and xylFGH genes, which encode for lactose, arabinose, and xylose transporters, respectively. As a case study of a minimal system, we build a generalizable physical model of the xapABR genetic circuit, which features a regulatory feedback loop via membrane transport (positive feedback) and enzymatic degradation (negative feedback) of an inducer. Dynamical systems analysis and stochastic simulations show that the membrane transport makes the model system bistable in certain parameter regimes. Thus, it serves as a genetic “on-off” switch, enabling the cell to only produce a set of metabolic enzymes when the corresponding metabolite is present in large amounts. We find that the negative feedback from the degradation enzyme does not significantly disturb the positive feedback from the membrane transporter. We investigate hysteresis in the switching and discuss the role of cooperativity and multiple binding sites in the model circuit. Fundamentally, this work explores how a stable genetic switch for a set of enzymes is obtained from transcriptional auto-activation of a membrane transporter through its substrate.},

Recent work has explored the use of information theory as a framework to understand the accuracy with which cells can ascertain the state of their surroundings. Yet the predictive power of these approaches is limited and has not been rigorously tested using precision measurements. To that end, we generate a minimal model for a simple genetic circuit in which all parameter values for the model come from independently published data sets. We then predict the information processing capacity of the genetic circuit for a suite of biophysical parameters such as protein copy number and protein-DNA affinity. We compare these parameter-free predictions with an experimental determination of protein expression distributions and the resulting information processing capacity of E. coli cells. We find that our minimal model captures the scaling of the cell-to-cell variability in the data and the inferred information processing capacity of our simple genetic circuit up to a systematic deviation.},

Many human miRNAs are intragenic, located within introns of protein-coding sequence (host). Intriguingly, a percentage of intragenic miRNAs downregulate the host transcript forming an incoherent feedforward motif topology. Here, we study intragenic miRNA-mediated host gene regulation using a synthetic gene circuit stably integrated within a safe-harbor locus of human cells. When the intragenic miRNA is directed to inhibit the host transcript, we observe a reduction in reporter expression accompanied by output filtering and noise reduction. Specifically, the system operates as a filter with respect to promoter strength, with the threshold being robust to promoter strength and measurement time. Additionally, the intragenic miRNA regulation reduces expression noise compared to splicing-alone architecture. Our results provide a new insight into miRNA-mediated gene expression, with direct implications to gene therapy and synthetic biology applications.},

   abstract = {Genetically-identical cells can show remarkable intercellular variability in the level of a given protein which is commonly known as the gene expression noise. Besides intrinsic fluctuations that arise from the inherent stochasticity of the biochemical processes, a significant source of expression noise is extrinsic. Such extrinsic noise in gene expression arises from cell-to-cell differences in expression machinery, transcription factors, cell size, and cell cycle stage. Here, we consider the synthesis of a transcription factor (TF) whose production is impacted by a dynamic extrinsic disturbance, and systematically investigate the regulation of expression noise by decoy sites that can sequester the TF. Our analysis shows that increasing decoy numbers reduce noise in the level of the free (unbound) TF with noise levels approaching the Poisson limit for large number of decoys. Interestingly, the suppression of expression noise compared to no-decoy levels is maximized at intermediate disturbance timescales. Finally, we quantify the noise propagation from the TF to a downstream target protein and find counterintuitive behaviors. More specifically, for nonlinear dose responses of target-protein activation, the noise in the target protein can increase with the inclusion of decoys, and this phenomenon is explained by smaller but more prolonged fluctuations in the TF level. In summary, our results illustrates the nontrivial effects of high-affinity decoys in shaping the stochastic dynamics of gene expression to alter cell fate and phenotype at the single-cell level.},

   abstract = {Advancing synthetic biology to the multicellular level requires the development of multiple cell-to-cell communication channels that propagate information with minimal signal interference. The development of quorum-sensing devices, the cornerstone technology for building microbial communities with coordinated system behaviour, has largely focused on cognate acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL)/transcription factor pairs, while the use of non-cognate pairs as a design feature has received limited attention. Here, we demonstrate a large library of AHL-receiver devices, with all cognate and non-cognate chemical signal interactions quantified, and we develop a software tool that automatically selects orthogonal communication channels. We use this approach to identify up to four orthogonal channels in silico, and experimentally demonstrate the simultaneous use of three channels in co-culture. The development of multiple non-interfering cell-to-cell communication channels is an enabling step that facilitates the design of synthetic consortia for applications including distributed bio-computation, increased bioprocess efficiency, cell specialisation and spatial organisation.},

Here, we demonstrate computationally how two classic genetic oscillators, the dual-feedback oscillator and the repressilator, can be re-designed to provide independent control of amplitude and period and improve tunability—that is, a broad dynamic range of periods and amplitudes accessible through the input “dials.” Our approach decouples frequency and amplitude modulation by incorporating an orthogonal “sink module” where the key molecular species are channeled for enzymatic degradation. This sink module maintains fast oscillation cycles while alleviating the translational coupling between the oscillator's transcription factors and output. We characterize the behavior of our re-designed oscillators over a broad range of physiologically reasonable parameters, explain why this facilitates broader function and control, and provide general design principles for building synthetic genetic oscillators that are more precisely controllable.

However, the expression of foreign proteins from engineered constructs is an unnatural burden that cells are not adapted for. Here we combined RNA-seq with an in vivo assay to identify the major transcriptional changes that occur in Escherichia coli when inducible synthetic constructs are expressed. We observed that native promoters related to the heat-shock response activated expression rapidly in response to synthetic expression, regardless of the construct. Using these promoters, we built a dCas9-based feedback-regulation system that automatically adjusts the expression of a synthetic construct in response to burden. Cells equipped with this general-use controller maintained their capacity for native gene expression to ensure robust growth and thus outperformed unregulated cells in terms of protein yield in batch production. This engineered feedback is to our knowledge the first example of a universal, burden-based biomolecular control system and is modular, tunable and portable.},

A primary goal of plant synthetic biology is to produce predictable and programmable genetic circuits from simple regulatory elements and well-characterized genetic components. The number of available DNA parts for plants is increasing, and the methods for rapid quantitative characterization are being developed, but the field of plant synthetic biology is still in its early stages. We here describe methods used to describe the quantitative properties of genetic components needed for plant synthetic biology. Once the quantitative properties and transfer function of a variety of genetic parts are known, computers can select the optimal components to assemble into functional devices, such as toggle switches and positive feedback circuits. However, while the variety of circuits and traits that can be put into plants are limitless, doing synthetic biology in plants poses unique challenges. Plants are composed of differentiated cells and tissues, each representing potentially unique regulatory or developmental contexts to introduced synthetic genetic circuits. Further, plants have evolved to be highly sensitive to environmental influences, such as light or temperature, any of which can affect the quantitative function of individual parts or whole circuits. Measuring the function of plant components within the context of a plant cell and, ideally, in a living plant, will be essential to using these components in gene circuits with predictable function. Mathematical modeling will be needed to account for the variety of contexts a genetic part will experience in different plant tissues or environments. With such understanding in hand, it may be possible to redesign plant traits to serve human and environmental needs.},

This program, which we term aggregation, is distinct from the canonical surface-biofilm formation program, which QS represses. Aggregation is induced by autoinducers, occurs rapidly in cell suspensions, and does not require cell-division, features strikingly dissimilar from those characteristic of V. cholerae biofilm formation. Extracellular DNA limits aggregate size, but is not sufficient to drive aggregation. A mutagenesis screen identifies genes required for aggregate formation, revealing proteins involved in V. cholerae intestinal colonization, stress response, and a protein that distinguishes the current V. cholerae pandemic strain from earlier pandemic strains. We suggest that QS-controlled aggregate formation is important for V. cholerae to successfully transit between the marine niche and the human host.},

Using CLASP fused to Crz1, we observe that, for the same integrated concentration of nuclear TF over time, changing input dynamics changes target gene expression: pulsatile inputs yield higher expression than continuous inputs, or vice versa, depending on the target gene. Computational modeling reveals that a dose-response saturating at low TF input can yield higher gene expression for pulsatile versus continuous input, and that multi-state promoter activation can yield the opposite behavior. Our integrated tool development and modeling approach characterize promoter responses to Crz1 nuclear translocation dynamics, extracting quantitative features that may help explain the differential expression of target genes.},

Here, we studied the activation of Bcl11b, which controls T-cell fate commitment. To disentangle cis and trans effects, we generated mice where two Bcl11b copies are tagged with distinguishable fluorescent proteins. Quantitative live microscopy of progenitors from these mice revealed that Bcl11b turned on after a stochastic delay averaging multiple days, which varied not only between cells but also between Bcl11b alleles within the same cell. Genetic perturbations, together with mathematical modeling, showed that a distal enhancer controls the rate of epigenetic activation, while a parallel Notch-dependent trans-acting step stimulates expression from activated loci. These results show that developmental fate transitions can be controlled by stochastic cis-acting events on individual loci.},

Here, we use synthetic biology approaches to engineer bistable gene networks to demonstrate that stochastic and permanent cell fate determination can be achieved through initializing gene regulatory networks (GRNs) at the boundary between dynamic attractors. We realize this experimentally by linking a synthetic GRN to a natural output of galactose metabolism regulation in yeast. Combining mathematical modeling and flow cytometry, we show that our engineered systems are bistable and that inherent gene expression stochasticity does not induce spontaneous state transitioning at steady state. Mathematical analysis predicts that stochastic cell fate determination in this case can only be realized when gene expression fluctuation occurs on or near attractor basin boundaries (the points of instability). Guided by numerical simulations, experiments are designed and performed with quantitatively diverse gene networks to test model predictions, which are verified by both flow cytometry and singlecell microscopy. By interfacing rationally designed synthetic GRNs with background gene regulation mechanisms, this work investigates intricate properties of networks that illuminate possible regulatory mechanisms for cell differentiation and development that can be initiated from points of instability.},

   abstract = {This article introduces the finite state projection (FSP) method for use in the stochastic analysis of chemically reacting systems. One can describe the chemical populations of such systems with probability density vectors that evolve according to a set of linear ordinary differential equations known as the chemical master equation (CME). Unlike Monte Carlo methods such as the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) or τ leaping, the FSP directly solves or approximates the solution of the CME. If the CME describes a system that has a finite number of distinct population vectors, the FSP method provides an exact analytical solution. When an infinite or extremely large number of population variations is possible, the state space can be truncated, and the FSP method provides a certificate of accuracy for how closely the truncated space approximation matches the true solution. The proposed FSP algorithm systematically increases the projection space in order to meet prespecified tolerance in the total probability density error. For any system in which a sufficiently accurate FSP exists, the FSP algorithm is shown to converge in a finite number of steps. The FSP is utilized to solve two examples taken from the field of systems biology, and comparisons are made between the FSP, the SSA, and τ leaping algorithms. In both examples, the FSP outperforms the SSA in terms of accuracy as well as computational efficiency. Furthermore, due to very small molecular counts in these particular examples, the FSP also performs far more effectively than τ leaping methods. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

Based on multivalent fluorescence amplification of the nascent polypeptide signal, we develop a method to image translation on individual mRNA molecules in real time in live cells, allowing direct visualization of translation events at the translation sites. Using this approach, we monitor transient changes of translation dynamics in responses to environmental stresses, capture distinct mobilities of individual polysomes in different subcellular compartments, and detect 3′ UTR-dependent local translation and active transport of polysomes in dendrites of primary neurons.},

In this study, we used an improved SunTag system to label nascent proteins and image translation of single messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) in human cells. Using a dedicated reporter RNA, we observe that translation of single mRNPs stochastically turns on and off while they diffuse through the cytoplasm. We further measure a ribosome density of 1.3 per kilobase and an elongation rate of 13-18 amino acids per second. Tagging the endogenous POLR2A gene revealed similar elongation rates and ribosomal densities and that nearly all messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are engaged in translation. Remarkably, tagging of the heavy chain of dynein 1 (DYNC1H1) shows this mRNA accumulates in foci containing three to seven RNA molecules. These foci are translation sites and thus represent specialized translation factories. We also observe that DYNC1H1 polysomes are actively transported by motors, which may deliver the mature protein at appropriate cellular locations. The SunTag should be broadly applicable to study translational regulation in live single cells.},

   abstract = {Allosteric regulation of protein function is widespread in biology, but is challenging for de novo protein design as it requires the explicit design of multiple states with comparable free energies. Here we explore the possibility of designing switchable protein systems de novo, through the modulation of competing inter-and intramolecular interactions. We design a static, five-helix 'cage' with a single interface that can interact either intramolecularly with a terminal 'latch' helix or intermolecularly with a peptide 'key'. Encoded on the latch are functional motifs for binding, degradation or nuclear export that function only when the key displaces the latch from the cage. We describe orthogonal cage-key systems that function in vitro, in yeast and in mammalian cells with up to 40-fold activation of function by key. The ability to design switchable protein functions that are controlled by induced conformational change is a milestone for de novo protein design, and opens up new avenues for synthetic biology and cell engineering. There has been considerable progress in the de novo design of stable protein structures on the basis of the principle that proteins fold to their lowest free-energy state. These efforts have focused on maximizing the free-energy gap between the desired structure and all other structures, and have resulted in a wide range of stable proteins that exclusively populate the designed state 1-4. Designing proteins that can switch conformations is more challenging because multiple states must have sufficiently low free energies relative to the unfolded state and the free-energy differences between the states must be small enough that switching can be toggled by an external input 5,6. Recent advances in designing systems with multiple states include a transmembrane ion transporter 7 and variants of Gβ1 that dynamically exchange between two related conformations 8 ; however, a method for the de novo design of modular, tunable protein systems that switch conformational states in the presence of an external input has not yet been achieved. We set out to design de novo switchable protein systems guided by the following considerations. First, programming free-energy differences between two states is more straightforward in a system that is governed by inter-and intramolecular competition at the same site than by allosteric activation at distant sites 9-11 because many of the residue level interactions can be similar (if not identical). Second, a stable protein framework with an extended binding surface that is available for the competing interactions is more programmable and less likely to engage in off-target interactions than a framework that becomes ordered only upon binding 12,13. These features are described by the abstract system in Fig. 1a, which undergoes thermodynamically driven switching between binding-competent and binding-incompetent states. A latch (blue) contains a peptide sequence (orange) that can bind a target (yellow) unless the binding surface is blocked by intramolecular interactions to a cage (cyan); a key (green) that binds more tightly to the cage outcompetes the latch, which enables the peptide to bind its target (colours refer to elements in the schematic in Fig. 1a). The behaviour of such a system is governed by binding equilibrium constants for the individual subreactions (Fig. 1a): K open , the dissociation of the latch from the cage; K LT , the binding of the latch to its target; and K CK , the binding of the cage to key. When the latch-cage interaction is too weak (red and orange curves in Fig. 1b, Supplementary Information), the system binds target in the presence of little-to-no key and the fold induction by key is low; when the latch-cage interaction is too strong (purple curve in Fig. 1b), the system only partially binds target even at high concentrations of key. The latch-cage interaction affinity that gives optimal switching (blue curve in Fig. 1b left, green curve in Fig. 1b right) is a function of the latch-target binding affinity. Designing 'latching orthogonal cage-key proteins' To implement the switchable system of Fig. 1a, we chose structural features that enable the tuning of the affinities of the cage-latch and cage-key interactions over a wide dynamic range. Helical interfaces are dominated by sidechain-sidechain interactions, which can more readily be tuned than the backbone hydrogen-bonding interactions between β-strands 14. To enable fine control over the specificity and relative affinities of the cage-latch and cage-key interactions, we chose to design interfaces containing buried hydrogen-bond networks; as in DNA base-pairing, specificity can be altered by minor changes to hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors 15. As a starting point, we connected a designed homotrimer of α-helical hairpins mediated by hydrogen-bond networks (5L6HC3_1 (ref. 15)) into two monomeric frameworks, by designing short unstructured loops between the sub-units (Fig. 1c). In the five-helix framework, there is an open binding site for a sixth helix added in trans; this site is filled by a sixth helix in cis in the six-helix framework. The five-helix (cage) and six-helix (cage plus latch) designs expressed in Escherichia coli were largely monomeric by size-exclusion chromatography (Extended Data Fig. 1), and remain folded up to 5 M gua-nidine hydrochloride (Fig. 1d). Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) spectra of the connected designs are similar to that of the starting},

   abstract = {Quantitative computational models play an increasingly important role in modern biology. Such models typically involve many free parameters, and assigning their values is often a substantial obstacle to model development. Directly measuring in vivo biochemical parameters is difficult, and collectively fitting them to other experimental data often yields large parameter uncertainties. Nevertheless, in earlier work we showed in a growth-factor- signaling model that collective fitting could yield well-constrained predictions, even when it left individual parameters very poorly constrained. We also showed that the model had a "sloppy" spectrum of parameter sensitivities, with eigenvalues roughly evenly distributed over many decades. Here we use a collection of models from the literature to test whether such sloppy spectra are common in systems biology. Strikingly, we find that every model we examine has a sloppy spectrum of sensitivities. We also test several consequences of this sloppiness for building predictive models. In particular, sloppiness suggests that collective fits to even large amounts of ideal time-series data will often leave many parameters poorly constrained. Tests over our model collection are consistent with this suggestion. This difficulty with collective fits may seem to argue for direct parameter measurements, but sloppiness also implies that such measurements must be formidably precise and complete to usefully constrain many model predictions. We confirm this implication in our growth-factor-signaling model. Our results suggest that sloppy sensitivity spectra are universal in systems biology models. The prevalence of sloppiness highlights the power of collective fits and suggests that modelers should focus on predictions rather than on parameters. © 2007 Gutenkunst et al.},

Specifically, we created six two-strain consortia, each possessing a unique mode of interaction, including commensalism, amensalism, neutralism, cooperation, competition and predation. These consortia follow distinct population dynamics with characteristics determined by the underlying interaction modes. We showed that models derived from two-strain consortia can be used to design three- and four-strain ecosystems with predictable behaviors and further extended to provide insights into community dynamics in space.

   abstract = {Ever since its foundational years, synthetic biology has been focused on the implementation of biological computing structures. In the beginning, engineered biological computation has mainly been based on uncoupled monoclonal cellular populations. Implementations of such computing structures were mostly inspired by digital electronic circuits and revealed many constraints that limited the advance of the field to relatively simple information processing structures. The focus has recently shifted towards the implementation of biological computing structures within coupled intercellular circuits composed of engineered cellular modules. These circuits have, however, advanced only to a certain point, namely to consist of a few engineered bacterial strains, which perform the computation. It is now time to make a transition from modules and relatively simple systems of biological processing structures to networks composing different strains each presenting a designated computing structure. In such networks, each strain is analogous to a logic chip on a breadboard circuit and is connected to other strains by means of intercellular communication mechanisms rather than copper wires. This analogy can be driven further to use a set of engineered biological modules to construct a complex computing system, such as a multicellular biological processor. We review the state of the art of distributed cellular computation, communication mechanisms, and computational analysis and design approaches for distributed biological computing. We demonstrate the potential next step in engineered biological computation by a proposal of a design of a multicellular biological processor. We demonstrate an analysis of the proposed computing network using in silico simulation and optimisation approaches.

Techniques, such as single-molecule fluorescence in-situ hybridization, microfluidics, and optogenetics, have opened the door to a large number of potential experiments, which begs the question of how to choose the best possible experiment. The Fisher information matrix (FIM) estimates how well potential experiments will constrain model parameters and can be used to design optimal experiments. Here, we introduce the finite state projection (FSP) based FIM, which uses the formalism of the chemical master equation to derive and compute the FIM. The FSP-FIM makes no assumptions about the distribution shapes of single-cell data, and it does not require precise measurements of higher order moments of such distributions. We validate the FSP-FIM against well-known Fisher information results for the simple case of constitutive gene expression. We then use numerical simulations to demonstrate the use of the FSP-FIM to optimize the timing of single-cell experiments with more complex, non-Gaussian fluctuations. We validate optimal simulated experiments determined using the FSP-FIM with Monte-Carlo approaches and contrast these to experiment designs chosen by traditional analyses that assume Gaussian fluctuations or use the central limit theorem. By systematically designing experiments to use all of the measurable fluctuations, our method enables a key step to improve co-design of experiments and quantitative models.},

   abstract = {Fluctuations in rates of gene expression can produce highly erratic time patterns of protein production in individual cells and wide diversity in instantaneous protein concentrations across cell populations. When two independently produced regulatory proteins acting at low cellular concentrations competitively control a switch point in a pathway, stochastic variations in their concentrations can produce probabilistic pathway selection, so that an initially homogeneous cell population partitions into distinct phenotypic subpopulations. Many pathogenic organisms, for example, use this mechanism to randomly switch surface features to evade host responses. This coupling between molecular-level fluctuations and macroscopic phenotype selection is analyzed using the phage λ lysis-lysogeny decision circuit as a model system. The fraction of infected cells selecting the lysogenic pathway at different phage:cell ratios, predicted using a molecular-level stochastic kinetic model of the genetic regulatory circuit, is consistent with experimental observations. The kinetic model of the decision circuit uses the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics, stochastic mechanisms of gene expression, and a statistical-thermodynamic model of promoter regulation. Conventional deterministic kinetics cannot be used to predict statistics of regulatory systems that produce probabilistic outcomes. Rather, a stochastic kinetic analysis must be used to predict statistics of regulatory outcomes for such stochastically regulated systems.},

   abstract = {There has been a resurgence of interest in non-equilibrium stochastic processes in recent years, driven in part by the observation that the number of molecules (genes, mRNA, proteins) involved in gene expression are often of order 1-1000. This means that deterministic mass-action kinetics tends to break down, and one needs to take into account the discrete, stochastic nature of biochemical reactions. One of the major consequences of molecular noise is the occurrence of stochastic biological switching at both the genotypic and phenotypic levels. For example, individual gene regulatory networks can switch between graded and binary responses, exhibit translational/transcriptional bursting, and support metastability (noise-induced switching between states that are stable in the deterministic limit). If random switching persists at the phenotypic level then this can confer certain advantages to cell populations growing in a changing environment, as exemplified by bacterial persistence in response to antibiotics. Gene expression at the single-cell level can also be regulated by changes in cell density at the population level, a process known as quorum sensing. In contrast to noise-driven phenotypic switching, the switching mechanism in quorum sensing is stimulus-driven and thus noise tends to have a detrimental effect. A common approach to modeling stochastic gene expression is to assume a large but finite system and to approximate the discrete processes by continuous processes using a system-size expansion. However, there is a growing need to have some familiarity with the theory of stochastic processes that goes beyond the standard topics of chemical master equations, the system-size expansion, Langevin equations and the Fokker-Planck equation. Examples include stochastic hybrid systems (piecewise deterministic Markov processes), large deviations and the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method, adiabatic reductions, and queuing/renewal theory. The major aim of this review is to provide a self-contained survey of these mathematical methods, mainly within the context of biological switching processes at both the genotypic and phenotypic levels. However, applications to other examples of biological switching are also discussed, including stochastic ion channels, diffusion in randomly switching environments, bacterial chemotaxis, and stochastic neural networks.},

Here we present a novel approach for stochastic simulation of networks embedded in the dynamic environment of the cell and its surroundings. We thus sample trajectories of the stochastic process described by the chemical master equation with time-varying propensities. A comparative analysis shows that existing approaches can either fail dramatically, or else can impose impractical computational burdens due to numerical integration of reaction propensities, especially when cell ensembles are studied. Here we introduce the Extrande method which, given a simulated time course of dynamic network inputs, provides a conditionally exact and several orders-of-magnitude faster simulation solution. The new approach makes it feasible to demonstrate—using decision-making by a large population of quorum sensing bacteria—that robustness to fluctuations from upstream signaling places strong constraints on the design of networks determining cell fate. Our approach has the potential to significantly advance both understanding of molecular systems biology and design of synthetic circuits.},

Here, we take a first step toward multipromoter dissection and show how a combination of massively parallel reporter assays, mass spectrometry, and information-theoretic modeling can be used to dissect multiple bacterial promoters in a systematic way. We show this approach on both well-studied and previously uncharacterized promoters in the enteric bacterium Escherichia coli. In all cases, we recover nucleotide-resolution models of promoter mechanism. For some promoters, including previously unannotated ones, the approach allowed us to further extract quantitative biophysical models describing input–output relationships.

We show that such control is theoretically impossible if restricted to a deterministic setting, but it can be achieved readily if one exploits heterogeneities introduced at the single-cell level due to stochastic fluctuations in gene regulation. Using stochastic analyses of a bistable genetic toggle switch, we develop a control strategy that maximizes the chances that a chosen cell will express one phenotype, while the rest express another. The control mechanism uses UV radiation to enhance identically protein degradation in all cells. Control of individual cells is made possible only by monitoring stochastic protein fluctuations and applying UV control at favorable times and levels. For two identical cells, our stochastic control law can drive protein expression of a chosen cell above its neighbor with a better than 99% success rate. In a population of 30 identical cells, we can drive a given cell to remain consistently within the top 20%. Although cellular noise typically impairs predictability for biological responses, our results show that it can also simultaneously improve controllability for those same responses.},

Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication.

   abstract = {Modern optical imaging experiments not only measure single-cell and single-molecule dynamics with high precision, but they can also perturb the cellular environment in myriad controlled and novel settings. Techniques, such as single-molecule fluorescence in-situ hybridization, microfluidics, and optogenetics, have opened the door to a large number of potential experiments, which begs the question of how to choose the best possible experiment. The Fisher information matrix (FIM) estimates how well potential experiments will constrain model parameters and can be used to design optimal experiments. Here, we introduce the finite state projection (FSP) based FIM, which uses the formalism of the chemical master equation to derive and compute the FIM. The FSP-FIM makes no assumptions about the distribution shapes of single-cell data, and it does not require precise measurements of higher order moments of such distributions. We validate the FSP-FIM against well-known Fisher information results for the simple case of constitutive gene expression. We then use numerical simulations to demonstrate the use of the FSP-FIM to optimize the timing of single-cell experiments with more complex, non-Gaussian fluctuations. We validate optimal simulated experiments determined using the FSP-FIM with Monte-Carlo approaches and contrast these to experiment designs chosen by traditional analyses that assume Gaussian fluctuations or use the central limit theorem. By systematically designing experiments to use all of the measurable fluctuations, our method enables a key step to improve co-design of experiments and quantitative models.},

It has been shown that a carefully selected periodic forcing can balance a population of such cells in an undifferentiated state. The effectiveness of these control strategies, however, can be hindered by the presence of stochastic perturbations and uncertainties typically observed in biological systems and is therefore not robust. Here, we propose the use of feedback control strategies to enhance robustness and performance of the balancing action by selecting in real-time both the amplitude and the duty-cycle of the pulsatile inputs affecting the toggle switch behavior. We show, via in silico experiments and realistic agent-based simulations, the effectiveness of the proposed strategies even in the presence of uncertainties, stochastic effects, cell growth, and inducer diffusion. In so doing, we confirm previous observations made in the literature about coherence of the population when pulsatile forcing inputs are used, but, contrary to what was proposed in the past, we leverage feedback control techniques to endow the balancing strategy with unprecedented robustness and stability properties. We compare via in silico experiments different external control solutions and show their advantages and limitations from an in vivo implementation viewpoint.},

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by binding to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Many human miRNAs are intragenic, located within introns of protein-coding sequence (host). Intriguingly, a percentage of intragenic miRNAs downregulate the host transcript forming an incoherent feedforward motif topology. Here, we study intragenic miRNA-mediated host gene regulation using a synthetic gene circuit stably integrated within a safe-harbor locus of human cells. When the intragenic miRNA is directed to inhibit the host transcript, we observe a reduction in reporter expression accompanied by output filtering and noise reduction. Specifically, the system operates as a filter with respect to promoter strength, with the threshold being robust to promoter strength and measurement time. Additionally, the intragenic miRNA regulation reduces expression noise compared to splicing-alone architecture. Our results provide a new insight into miRNA-mediated gene expression, with direct implications to gene therapy and synthetic biology applications.},

   abstract = {Although messenger RNA (mRNA) translation is a fundamental biological process, it has never been imaged in real time in vivo with single-molecule precision.To achieve this, we developed nascent chain tracking (NCT), a technique that uses multi-epitope tags and antibody-based fluorescent probes to quantify protein synthesis dynamics at the single-mRNA level. NCT reveals an elongation rate of ∼10 amino acids per second, with initiation occurring stochastically every ∼30 seconds. Polysomes contain ∼1 ribosome every 200 to 900 nucleotides and are globular rather than elongated in shape. By developingmulticolor probes,we showed thatmost polysomes act independently; however, a small fraction (∼5%) form complexes in which two distinctmRNAs can be translated simultaneously.The sensitivity and versatility ofNCTmake it a powerful new tool for quantifying mRNA translation kinetics.},

When integrated into smaller com-partments, such as living or synthetic cells, controllers have to be calibratedto factor in the intrinsic noise. In this context, biochemical controllers put for-ward in the literature have focused on manipulating the mean (first moment)and reducing the variance (second moment) of the target molecular species.However, many critical biochemical processes are realized via higher-ordermoments, particularly the number and configuration of the probability distri-bution modes (maxima). To bridge the gap, we put forward thestochasticmorphercontroller that can, under suitable timescale separations, morph theprobability distribution of the target molecular species into a predefinedform. The morphing can be performed at a lower-resolution, allowing oneto achieve desired multi-modality/multi-stability, and at a higher-resolution,allowing one to achieve arbitrary probability distributions. Properties of thecontroller, such as robustness and convergence, are rigorously established,and demonstrated on various examples.

Extracellular DNA limits aggregate size, but is not sufficient to drive aggregation. A mutagenesis screen identifies genes required for aggregate formation, revealing proteins involved in \textit\{V. cholerae\} intestinal colonization, stress response, and a protein that distinguishes the current \textit\{V. cholerae\} pandemic strain from earlier pandemic strains.

A pressing open challenge in Synthetic Biology is to design and implement synthetic circuits to control host cells’ behavior, in order to regulate and maintain desired conditions. To cope with the high degree of circuit complexity required to accomplish this task and the intrinsic modularity of classical control schemes, we suggest the implementation of synthetic endogenous feedback loops across more than one cell population. The distribution of the sensing, computation, and actuation functions required to achieve regulation across different cell populations within a consortium allows the genetic engineering in a particular cell to be reduced, increases the robustness, and makes it possible to reuse the synthesized modules for different control applications. Here, we analyze, in-silico, the design of a synthetic feedback controller implemented across two cell populations in a consortium. We study the effects of distributing the various functions required to build a control system across two populations, prove the robustness and modularity of the strategy described, and provide a computational proof-of-concept of its feasibility.},

Techniques, such as single-molecule fluorescence in-situ hybridization, microfluidics, and optogenetics, have opened the door to a large number of potential experiments, which begs the question of how to choose the best possible experiment. The Fisher information matrix (FIM) estimates how well potential experiments will constrain model parameters and can be used to design optimal experiments. Here, we introduce the finite state projection (FSP) based FIM, which uses the formalism of the chemical master equation to derive and compute the FIM. The FSP-FIM makes no assumptions about the distribution shapes of single-cell data, and it does not require precise measurements of higher order moments of such distributions. We validate the FSP-FIM against well-known Fisher information results for the simple case of constitutive gene expression. We then use numerical simulations to demonstrate the use of the FSP-FIM to optimize the timing of single-cell experiments with more complex, non-Gaussian fluctuations. We validate optimal simulated experiments determined using the FSP-FIM with Monte-Carlo approaches and contrast these to experiment designs chosen by traditional analyses that assume Gaussian fluctuations or use the central limit theorem. By systematically designing experiments to use all of the measurable fluctuations, our method enables a key step to improve co-design of experiments and quantitative models.},

It has remained unclear what functional roles such constitutive splicing provides. To explore this issue, we asked how splicing affects the efficiency with which individual pre-messenger RNA transcripts are productively processed across different gene expression levels. We developed a quantitative single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization-based method to quantify splicing efficiency at transcription active sites in single cells. We found that both natural and synthetic genes in mouse and human cells exhibited an unexpected ‘economy of scale’ behavior in which splicing efficiency increased with transcription rate. Correlations between splicing efficiency and spatial proximity to nuclear speckles could explain this counterintuitive behavior. Functionally, economy of scale splicing represents a non-linear filter that amplifies the expression of genes when they are more strongly transcribed. These results indicate that constitutive splicing plays an active functional role in modulating gene expression.},

To deal with such a problem, a linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) optimal control algorithm and a robust back-stepping control strategy are proposed using Kalman filter. Firstly, the Kalman filter is used as a state observer for HFV to estimate the true states polluted by noises. Then, a linear LQG controller is proposed to realize the tracking control with the estimated states. In addition, to deal with the more practical case that the system suffers from both measurement noises and system uncertainties, a robust back-stepping control scheme based on Kalman filter and disturbance observer is presented. Different from the existing results, the proposed control scheme can guarantee the tracking performance under measurement noises and uncertainties.

   abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) has become one of the most popular control techniques in the process industry mainly because of its ability to deal with multiple-input-multiple-output plants and with constraints. However, in the presence of model uncertainties and disturbances its performance can deteriorate. Therefore, the development of robust MPC techniques has been widely discussed during the last years, but they were rarely, if at all, applied in practice due to the conservativeness or the computational complexity of the approaches. In this paper, we present multi-stage NMPC as a promising robust non-conservative nonlinear model predictive control scheme. The approach is based on the representation of the evolution of the uncertainty by a scenario tree, and leads to a non-conservative robust control of the uncertain plant because the adaptation of future inputs to new information is taken into account. Simulation results show that multi-stage NMPC outperforms standard and min-max NMPC under the presence of uncertainties for a semi-batch polymerization benchmark problem. In addition, the advantages of the approach are illustrated for the case where only noisy measurements are available and the unmeasured states and the uncertainties have to be estimated using an observer. It is shown that better performance can be achieved than by estimating the unknown parameters online and adapting the plant model. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

This stochastic variability is prominent when molecules have low abundance, which is the case for mRNA noise. Most studies focused on how transcription affects mRNA noise, and little is known about the role of RNA degradation. To discriminate the fluctuations in these processes during the decay of a pair of reporter mRNAs, we quantified the uncorrelated intrinsic and the correlated extrinsic noise using single-molecule RNA FISH. Intrinsic noise converges to the Poisson level during the decay. mRNAs that have a short half-life are more susceptible to extrinsic noise than stable mRNAs. However, the Xrn1 exonuclease and the NMD pathways, which degrade mRNAs rapidly, were found to have lower fluctuation, which mitigates the noise of the short-lived mRNAs. This permits low variability across the entire range of mRNA half-lives. Baudrimont et al. show that fluctuations in transcription and RNA degradation can be distinguished by assessing whether extrinsic noise increases during decay. Unstable RNAs are more susceptible to noise, but the activity of the enzymes that degrade them fluctuates less in comparison to those that target stable mRNAs.},

   abstract = {Integral feedback control is commonly used in mechanical and electrical systems to achieve zero steady-state error following an external disturbance. Equivalently, in biological systems, a property known as robust perfect adaptation guarantees robustness to environmental perturbations and return to the pre-disturbance state. Previously, Briat et al proposed a biomolecular design for integral feedback control (robust perfect adaptation) called the antithetic feedback motif. The antithetic feedback controller uses the sequestration binding reaction of two biochemical species to record the integral of the error between the current and the desired output of the network it controls. The antithetic feedback motif has been successfully built using synthetic components in vivo in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. However, these previous synthetic implementations of antithetic feedback have not produced perfect integral feedback control due to the degradation and dilution of the two controller species. Furthermore, previous theoretical results have cautioned that integral control can only be achieved under stability conditions that not all antithetic feedback motifs necessarily fulfill. In this paper, we study how to design antithetic feedback motifs that simultaneously achieve good stability and small steady-state error properties, even as the controller species are degraded and diluted. We provide simple tuning guidelines to achieve flexible and practical synthetic biological implementations of antithetic feedback control. We use several tools and metrics from control theory to design antithetic feedback networks, paving the path for the systematic design of synthetic biological controllers.},

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), for example, guide Argonaute and associated proteins to target mRNAs, where they direct gene silencing in multiple ways that are not well understood. To better deconvolve these dynamics, we have developed technology to directly visualize and quantify the impact of human Argonaute2 (Ago2) on the translation and subcellular localization of individual reporter mRNAs in living cells. We show that our combined translation and Ago2 tethering sensor reflects endogenous miRNA-mediated gene silencing. Using the sensor, we find that Ago2 association leads to progressive silencing of translation at individual mRNA. Silencing was occasionally interrupted by brief bursts of translational activity and took 3–4 times longer than a single round of translation, consistent with a gradual increase in the inhibition of translation initiation. At later time points, Ago2-tethered mRNAs cluster and coalesce with P-bodies, where a translationally silent state is maintained. These results provide a framework for exploring miRNA-mediated gene regulation in live cells at the single-molecule level. Furthermore, our tethering-based, single-molecule reporter system will likely have wide-ranging application in studying RNA-protein interactions.},

The desired controller is aimed to robustly stabilize the plant, to minimize the linear quadratic (LQ) cost, and to satisfy diverse pre-specified mean power limits associated with individual elements of the control law, simultaneously. Within the framework of system level synthesis, the performance objective and power constraints, together with relevant upper bounds, over all admissible uncertainties are characterized in terms of system responses of the closed-loop system and statistics of the communication channels. Based on this characterization, numerically tractable algorithms are proposed for controller synthesis. The counterpart for deterministic systems is also discussed as a special case with corresponding algorithms being provided. Moreover, the relative performance loss incurred by the size of model uncertainties and the finite truncation is explicitly established.

   abstract = {Optogenetic tools are widely used to control gene expression dynamics both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. These tools are used in a variety of biological applications from stem cell differentiation to metabolic engineering. Despite some tools already available in bacteria, no light-inducible system currently exists to control gene expression independently from mammalian transcriptional and/or translational machineries thus working orthogonally to endogenous regulatory mechanisms. Such a tool would be particularly important in synthetic biology, where orthogonality is advantageous to achieve robust activation of synthetic networks. Here we implement, characterize, and optimize a new optogenetic tool in mammalian cells based on a previously published system in bacteria called Opto-T7RNAPs. The tool is orthogonal to the cellular machinery for transcription and consists of a split T7 RNA polymerase coupled with the blue light-inducible magnets system (mammalian OptoT7-mOptoT7). In our study we exploited the T7 polymerase's viral origins to tune our system's expression level, reaching up to an almost 20-fold change activation over the dark control. mOptoT7 is used here to generate mRNA for protein expression, shRNA for protein inhibition, and Pepper aptamer for RNA visualization. Moreover, we show that mOptoT7 can mitigate the gene expression burden when compared to another optogenetic construct. These properties make mOptoT7 a powerful new tool to use when orthogonality and viral RNA species (that lack endogenous RNA modifications) are desired.},

   abstract = {This article introduces the finite state projection (FSP) method for use in the stochastic analysis of chemically reacting systems. One can describe the chemical populations of such systems with probability density vectors that evolve according to a set of linear ordinary differential equations known as the chemical master equation (CME). Unlike Monte Carlo methods such as the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) or τ leaping, the FSP directly solves or approximates the solution of the CME. If the CME describes a system that has a finite number of distinct population vectors, the FSP method provides an exact analytical solution. When an infinite or extremely large number of population variations is possible, the state space can be truncated, and the FSP method provides a certificate of accuracy for how closely the truncated space approximation matches the true solution. The proposed FSP algorithm systematically increases the projection space in order to meet prespecified tolerance in the total probability density error. For any system in which a sufficiently accurate FSP exists, the FSP algorithm is shown to converge in a finite number of steps. The FSP is utilized to solve two examples taken from the field of systems biology, and comparisons are made between the FSP, the SSA, and τ leaping algorithms. In both examples, the FSP outperforms the SSA in terms of accuracy as well as computational efficiency. Furthermore, due to very small molecular counts in these particular examples, the FSP also performs far more effectively than τ leaping methods. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

   abstract = {The dynamics of chemical reaction networks often takes place on widely differing time scales—from the order of nanoseconds to the order of several days. This is particularly true for gene regulatory networks, which are modeled by chemical kinetics. Multiple time scales in mathematical models often lead to serious computational difficulties, such as numerical stiffness in the case of differential equations or excessively redundant Monte Carlo simulations in the case of stochastic processes. We present a model reduction method for study of stochastic chemical kinetic systems that takes advantage of multiple time scales. The method applies to finite projections of the chemical master equation and allows for effective time scale separation of the system dynamics. We implement this method in a novel numerical algorithm that exploits the time scale separation to achieve model order reductions while enabling error checking and control. We illustrate the efficiency of our method in several examples motivated by recent developments in gene regulatory networks.},

Recently, the design of molecular PID-controllers has been identified as an important goal for synthetic biology and the field of cybergenetics. In this paper, we consider the realization of PID-controllers via biomolecular reactions. We propose an array of topologies offering a compromise between simplicity and high performance. We first demonstrate that different biomolecular PI-controllers exhibit different performance-enhancing capabilities. Next, we introduce several derivative controllers based on incoherent feedforward loops acting in a feedback configuration. Alternatively, we show that differentiators can be realized by placing molecular integrators in a negative feedback loop, which can be augmented by PI-components to yield PID-controllers. We demonstrate that PID-controllers can enhance stability and dynamic performance, and can also reduce stochastic noise. Finally, we provide an experimental demonstration using a hybrid setup where in silico PID-controllers regulate a genetic circuit in single yeast cells.},

   abstract = {Simulation of biomolecular networks is now indispensable for studying biological systems, from small reaction networks to large ensembles of cells. Here we present a novel approach for stochastic simulation of networks embedded in the dynamic environment of the cell and its surroundings. We thus sample trajectories of the stochastic process described by the chemical master equation with time-varying propensities. A comparative analysis shows that existing approaches can either fail dramatically, or else can impose impractical computational burdens due to numerical integration of reaction propensities, especially when cell ensembles are studied. Here we introduce the Extrande method which, given a simulated time course of dynamic network inputs, provides a conditionally exact and several orders-of-magnitude faster simulation solution. The new approach makes it feasible to demonstrate—using decision-making by a large population of quorum sensing bacteria—that robustness to fluctuations from upstream signaling places strong constraints on the design of networks determining cell fate. Our approach has the potential to significantly advance both understanding of molecular systems biology and design of synthetic circuits.},

   abstract = {A toggle switch consists of two genes that mutually repress each other. This regulatory motif is active during cell differentiation and is thought to act as a memory device, being able to choose and maintain cell fate decisions. Commonly, this switch has been modeled in a deterministic framework where transcription and translation are lumped together. In this description, bistability occurs for transcription factor cooperativity, whereas autoactivation leads to a tristable system with an additional undecided state. In this contribution, we study the stability and dynamics of a two-stage gene expression switch within a probabilistic framework inspired by the properties of the Pu/Gata toggle switch in myeloid progenitor cells. We focus on low mRNA numbers, high protein abundance, and monomeric transcription-factor binding. Contrary to the expectation from a deterministic description, this switch shows complex multiattractor dynamics without autoactivation and cooperativity. Most importantly, the four attractors of the system, which only emerge in a probabilistic two-stage description, can be identified with committed and primed states in cell differentiation. To begin, we study the dynamics of the system and infer the mechanisms that move the system between attractors using both the quasipotential and the probability flux of the system. Next, we show that the residence times of the system in one of the committed attractors are geometrically distributed. We derive an analytical expression for the parameter of the geometric distribution, therefore completely describing the statistics of the switching process and elucidate the influence of the system parameters on the residence time. Moreover, we find that the mean residence time increases linearly with the mean protein level. This scaling also holds for a one-stage scenario and for autoactivation. Finally, we study the implications of this distribution for the stability of a switch and discuss the influence of the stability on a specific cell differentiation mechanism. Our model explains lineage priming and proposes the need of either high protein numbers or long-term modifications such as chromatin remodeling to achieve stable cell fate decisions. Notably, we present a system with high protein abundance that nevertheless requires a probabilistic description to exhibit multistability, complex switching dynamics, and lineage priming. © 2012 Biophysical Society.},

Resistance genes are used to select desired cells and regulate bacterial populations, however their use to-date has been largely static. Precise spatiotemporal control of antibiotic resistance could enable a wide variety of applications that require dynamic control of susceptibility and survival. Here, we use light-inducible Cre recombinase to activate expression of drug resistance genes in Escherichia coli. We demonstrate light-activated resistance to four antibiotics: carbenicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline. Cells exposed to blue light survive in the presence of lethal antibiotic concentrations, while those kept in the dark do not. To optimize resistance induction, we vary promoter, ribosome binding site, and enzyme variant strength using chromosome and plasmid-based constructs. We then link inducible resistance to expression of a heterologous fatty acid enzyme to increase production of octanoic acid. These optogenetic resistance tools pave the way for spatiotemporal control of cell survival.},
